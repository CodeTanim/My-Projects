NOTE: here are some ways you can test out the program:

Type in numbers manually:
+[04]$ ./sum
3
7
5
10
sum is 25
(Hit ctrl+d to end the input.)

Use the `echo` command:
+[04]$ echo 3 7 5 10
3 7 5 10
+[04]$ echo 3 7 5 10 | ./sum
sum is 25

`echo` a range of numbers:
+[04]$ echo {1..10}
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
+[04]$ echo {1..10} | ./sum
sum is 55

Make a test file:
+[04]$ echo {1..10} > numbers
+[04]$ cat numbers
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
+[04]$ ./sum < numbers
sum is 55

TODO: try to understand the above shell commands.
